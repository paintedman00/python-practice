A Python-based Hangman game where players attempt to guess a randomly chosen word before running out of lives.

## Features

- ASCII art representations of the Hangman stages
- Clear game prompts and feedback
- Interactive command-line gameplay

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `replit` module (for clearing the console during gameplay)

## Installation

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/paintedman00/python-practice.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh

   ```
3. Ensure you have Python installed:
   ```sh
   python --version

## Usage

```

## Game Rules
1. A random word is chosen at the start of the game.
2. Players guess letters one at a time.
3. If the guessed letter is correct, it is revealed in the word.
4. If incorrect, a life is lost and the Hangman figure progresses.
5. The game ends when the player correctly guesses the word or loses all lives.
