# Simple Alarm Clock

A basic command-line alarm clock.  It prompts the user for an alarm time (in HH:MM format) and then waits until that time before printing a message.

## Usage

Run `python main.py` and follow the prompts to set your alarm.

## Example

```
$ python main.py
Enter alarm time (HH:MM): 07:30
Alarm set for 07:30.
... (waits until 7:30 AM) ...
Wake up! It's 07:30.
```
