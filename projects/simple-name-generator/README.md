# Simple Name Generator

A simple command-line tool to generate names based on a given pattern.

## Usage

Run `python main.py` and follow the prompts to enter a pattern and the desired number of names.

## Example

```
python main.py
```

The program will then ask for a name pattern and the quantity of names you want to generate. For instance, a pattern like 'Aaa' will generate names starting with one uppercase letter followed by two lowercase letters. Example generated name: 'Zoe'.
