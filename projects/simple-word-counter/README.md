# Simple Word Counter

A simple command-line tool that counts the number of words in a given text input or file.

## Usage

1.  Run the script: `python main.py`
2.  Enter text directly or provide a filename when prompted.
3.  The script will output the word count.

## Example

```
python main.py
Do you want to enter text directly or provide a filename? (text/file): text
Enter your text: This is a simple sentence.
Word count: 5
```

```
python main.py
Do you want to enter text directly or provide a filename? (text/file): file
Enter filename: example.txt
Word count: [Number of words in example.txt]
```

## Notes

*   The script considers words to be separated by spaces.
*   Punctuation is included as part of the word.
